Game Dev project 2. Star Wars space shooter

How to play:
1) Choose between Medium, Hard, and Jedi mode as a difficulty to start the game. Default is easy, where the enemies are not shooting.
2) Use the arrow keys to move your space ship, space bar to shoot.
3) Shoot enemies and survive against the final boss as the time runs down.

Try not to get hit twice in the same area of the ship (left, middle, right).

If you survive the time limit, you activate hyperdrive and win the game.
